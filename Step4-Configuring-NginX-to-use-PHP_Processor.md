When using the Nginx web server, we can create server blocks (similar to virtual hosts in Apache) to encapsualte configuration details and host more than one domain on a single server. In this guide, we will use **projectLEMP** as an example domain name. 

On Ubuntu 20.04. Nginx has one server block enabled by default and is configured to serve documents out of directory at ```/var/www/html```. While this world well for a single site, it can become difficult to manage if you are hosting multiple sites. Instead of modifying ```/var/www/html```, we'll create a directory structure within ```/var/www```  
for the **your_domain** website, leaving ```/var/www/html``` in place as the default directory to be served if a client request does not match any other sites.  

Create the root web directory for **your_domain** as follows:  

```
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP
```

Next, assing ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, which will reference your current system user:  

```
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP 
```

Then, open a new configuration file in Nginx's ```sites-available``` directory using your preffered command-line editor. Here, we'll use ```nano```:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP
```

This will create a new blank file. Paste in the following bare-bones configuration:  

```
#/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

server {
      listen 80;
      server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
      root /var/www/projectLEMP;

      index index.html index.htm index.php;

      location / {
          try_files $uri $uri/ =404; 
}

location ~ \.php$ {
      include snippets/fastcgi - php.conf;
      fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
}

location ~ /\.ht {
      deny all;
      }
}
```

Here's what each of these directives and location blocks do:

* ```listen``` -Defines what port Nginx will listen on. In this case, it will listen on port ```80```, the default port for HTTP.
* ```root``` -Defines the document root where the files served by this website are stored.
* ```index``` -Defines in which order Nginx will prioritize index files for this website. It is a common practice to list ```index.html``` files with a higher precedence than ```index.php``` files to allow for quickly setting up a maintenance landing page in PHP applications. You can adjust these settings to better suit your application needs.
* ```server_name``` -Defines which domain names and/or IP addresses this server block should respond for. **Point this directive to your server's name or public IP address**.
* ```location /``` - The first location block includes a ```try_files``` directive, which checks for the existence of files or directories matching a URL request. If Nginx cannot find the appropriate resource, it will return a 404 error.
* ```location ~ \.php$``` -This location block handles the actual PHP processing by pointing Nginx to the fastcgi-php.conf configuration file and the ```php7.4-fpm.sock file```, which declares what socket is associated with ```php-fpm```.
* ```location ~ /\.ht``` -The last location block deals with ```.htaccess``` files, which Nginx does not process. By adding the deny all directive, if any ```.htaccess``` files happen to find their way into the document root, they will not be served to visitors.

When you're done editing, save and close the file. If you're using ```nano```, you can do so by typing ```CTRL+X``` and then ```y``` and ```ENTER``` to confirm.  

Activate your configuration by linking to the config file from Nginx's ```sites-enabled``` directory:  

```
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
``` 

This will tell Nginx to use the configuration next time it is reloaded. You can test your configuration for syntax errors by typing:  

```
$ sudo nginx -t
```  
You shall see following message:  

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```  

If any errors aree reported, go back to your configuration file to review its contents before continuing.  

We also need to disable default Nginx host that is currently configured to listen on port 80, for this run:  

``` 
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
``` 
When you are ready, reload Nginx to apply the changes:  

```
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
```  

Your new website is now active, but the web root /var/www/projectLEMP is still empty. Create an index.html file in that location so that we can test that your new server block works as expected:  

``` 
sudo sh -c "echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html"

```
